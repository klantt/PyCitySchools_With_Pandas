## Overview of the school district analysis
  -The overall end goal of this analysis was to find specific data across multiple school districts. The data I collected and organised includes Student ID, name, gender, grade, school attended, budget, type of school, size, math scores, and reading scores among finding the averages for those subjects. 
     
## Results
  -In the results that I found while going over the data collected I found a few interesting points that differt from school type to budget and size. Below I will list a few key differences and outcomes. 
  -First I found that school type definitely had an affect on average grades and overall passing. For example charter schools seemed to outperform district schools in both reading averages and math averages.

  -Another trend I noticed was the average math scores and reading scores across grades 9, 10, 11, and 12 are all relatively the same and consistent.

  -Lastly looking at the two school types and the differences in budget really seemed to make a difference in overall passing percents and grades being higher. It seems that the more money a school has access to the more resources teachers and staff have at there disposal to improve a students learning experience and educational.

## Summary
  -In coclusion a few major changes I noticed in the data was that budget is key. The district schools have a major disadvantage at providing a better educational experience for kids in all four grades analyzed. Second it seemed the difference in being a charter versus a district school as shown above the average grades are just better across the board. I'm sure the budget being so much larger per student/school in the charter system has everything to do with that outcome. It seems that is the overall recurring event/variable in this data set analysis.
